## trying to get a minimal working proof. 
not going to include all the details,
but need enough stuff to be able to tell
if its gonna work or not.

# these tex documents have proofs that feel almost right, 
  but don't return to working on these until you get a proof that
  is actually sound in a md file 

sec5_clever.tex
  - trying to do the base case and the amplification lemma is on
  lemma about repeating strategies

sec5_obliviousAmplify.tex
  - super broken amp lemma attempt

sec5_obliviousBase_broken.tex
  - before I decided using realN was important, by now I'm fairly
  certain doing so is essential

sec5_oblivious_realN.tex
  - close on the base case, but has no guarantees for if the
  empteir does extra empties on it. these are actually important
  to have it turns out.
