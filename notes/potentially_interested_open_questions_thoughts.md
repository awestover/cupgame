# cup game notes
# potentially interesting open questions

- multi-processor Omega(log p) lower bound or O(log log n) upper bound?
- variable-processor more general lower bound 

# vanilla multi-processor cup game
results:

  - O(log p + log log n) with probability 1-exp(-polylog n) for the first exp(polylog n) rounds
      * could I improve this?
  - Omega(log log p) with constant probability
      * could I improve this?
  - Omega(log n) in arbitrarily long games vs greedy-like
      * could I improve this?
