\section{Conclusion}
Many important open questions remain open. Can our oblivious cup game results
be improved, e.g. by expanding them to apply to a broader class of emptiers?
Can the classic oblivious multi-processor cup-game be tightly analyzed?

Maybe more importantly is the implications for analysis of
parallel algorithms in general. Are there other problems where
letting the number of processors change drastically effects the
outcome? This is important to look into.
