\section{Technical Overview}
\label{sec:technical_overview}

In this section we provide sketches of the proofs in the paper,
omitting many details.

\subsection{Adaptive Lower Bound}
In \cref{sec:adaptive} we provide filling strategies that an
adaptive filler can use to achieve backlog $\poly(n)$; in this
subsection we sketch the proofs of these results.

First we note that there is a trivial algorithm, that we call
\defn{$\trivalg$}, for achieving backlog at least $1/2$ on at
least $2$ cups in time $O(1)$.

The essential ingredient in the proof is the Amplification
Lemma, which gives a way to transform a filling strategy
$\alg(f)$ into a new filling strategy $\alg(f')$, called the
\defn{amplification} of $\alg(f)$, that achieves backlog at
least 
$$f'(n) \ge (1-\delta) f(\floor{(1-\delta)n}) + f(\ceil{\delta
n}).$$
To achieve this the filler designates an \defn{anchor set} $A$ of size
$\ceil{\delta n}$ and a \defn{non-anchor set} $B$ of size
$\floor{(1-\delta)n}$. The filler's strategy is roughly as follows:\\
\textbf{Step 1:} Get $\mu(A) \ge (1-\delta) f(|B|)$ by using $\alg(f)$ repeatedly
on $B$ to achieve cups with fill at least $f(|B|)+\mu(B)$ in $B$ and
then swapping these into $A$. The filler always places $1$ unit
of fill into each anchor cup while doing this.\\
\textbf{Step 2:} Use $\alg(f)$ once on $A$ to obtain some cup
with fill $\mu(A)+f(|A|)$.\\
Note that in order to use $\alg(f)$ on subsets of the cups the
filler will need to vary $p$.

Consider Step 1. We say that the emptier \defn{neglects} the
anchor set on a round if the emptier does not empty from all
anchor cups on that round. By neglecting the anchor set the
emptier can place more resources into the non-anchor set than the
filler, which can prevent the filler from getting a cup with fill
$\mu(B) + f(|B|)$. On the other hand, neglecting the anchor set
increases the mass of the anchor set. If the emptier neglects the
anchor set too many times, then the filler gets high fill in the
anchor set because the mass of the anchor set increases when the
anchor set is neglected. If the emptier does not neglect the
anchor set too many times, then the filler will be able to get
cups with high fill in $B$, and swap these into $A$, which also
results in the mass of the anchor set increasing. It can be shown
that after at most $|A|$ applications of $\alg(f)$ to $B$ the
anchor set will have achieved average fill at least $(1-\delta)
f(|B|)$.

Step 2 trivially succeeds.
Thus we have achieved backlog
$$(1-\delta) f(|B|) + f(|A|), $$
as desired.

Now we use the Amplification Lemma to prove two theorems.

First, say we aim to achieve backlog $\Omega(n^{1-\varepsilon})$
for constant $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$. We construct a sequence of
filling strategies with $\alg(f_{i+1})$ the amplification of
$\alg(f_i)$ using $\delta = \Theta(1)$ to be determined as a
function of $\varepsilon$, and $\alg(f_0)=\trivalg$.
Choosing $\delta$ appropriately, we show by induction on $i$ that
$\alg(f_{\Theta(\lg n)})$ achieves backlog
$\Omega(n^{1-\varepsilon})$ in running time $2^{O(\log^2 n)}$.

Now, say we aim to achieve backlog $\Omega(n)$.
We construct a sequence of filling strategies with $\alg(f_{i+1})$ the
amplification of $\alg(f_i)$ using $\delta = 1/(i+1)$, and
$\alg(f_0)$ a filling strategy for achieving backlog $1$ on
$O(1)$ cups in $O(1)$ time (this is a slight modification of
$\trivalg$). We show by induction on $i$ that
$\alg(f_{\Theta(n)})$ achieves backlog $\Omega(n)$ in running
time $O(n!)$.

\subsection{Upper Bound}
In \cref{sec:upperBound} we prove that a greedy emptier, i.e. an
emptier that always empties from the $p$ fullest cups, never lets
backlog exceed $O(n)$; in this subsection we sketch the proof of
this result.
This upper bound on backlog follows directly from a set of
invariants that we prove are maintained: the
average fill of the $k$ fullest cups is at most $2n-k$.

We now sketch the proof that the invariants are always
maintained. The proof is by induction on the round. Fix some
round $t$ and assume that all invariants hold on round $t$. Fix
some $k$; we aim to prove that the average fill of the $k$
fullest cups is at most $2n-k$ at the start of round $t+1$. 

Let $A$ be the cups that are among the $k$ fullest cups in $I_t$,
are emptied from, and are among the $k$ fullest cups in
$S_{t+1}$. Let $B$ be the cups that are among the $k$ fullest
cups in state $I_t$, are emptied from, and are not among the $k$
fullest cups in $S_{t+1}$. Let $C$ be the cups with ranks $|A| +
|B| + 1, \ldots, k + |B|$ in state $I_t$. The set $C$ is defined
so that the $k$ fullest cups in state $S_{t+1}$ are $AC$, since
once the cups in $B$ are emptied from, the cups in $B$ are not
among the $k$ fullest cups, so cups in $C$ take their places
among the $k$ fullest cups.

We show that we may assume without loss of generality that
$S_t(r) = I_t(r)$ for each rank $r \in [n]$, by changing the
labels of the cups; intuitively this is true because if a cup $c$
changes ranks from $S_t$ to $I_t$, then some other cup must have
fill very close to $c$'s fill.

We prove the invariant by considering several cases.

\noindent\textbf{Case 1}:
Some cup in $A$ zeroes out in round $t$.\\
\textbf{Analysis}:
The fill of all cups in $C$ must be at most $1$ at state $I_t$ to be
less than the fill of the cup in $A$ that zeroed out. Further,
$A$ has average fill at most $2n-(a-1)$ due to the cup with zero
fill. Combined, with some algebra, these facts imply that the
average fill in $AC$ is not too large, in particular not larger
than $2n-k$.

\noindent\textbf{Case 2}:
No cups in $A$ zero out in round $t$ and $b=0$.\\
\textbf{Analysis}:
In this case $S_{t+1}([k]) = S_t([k])$.
During round $t$ the emptier removes $a$ units of fill from the
cups in $S_t([k])$, specifically the cups in $A$. The filler
cannot have added more than $k$ fill to these cups, because it
can add at most $1$ fill to any given cup. Also, the filler
cannot have added more than $p_t$ fill to the cups because this
is the total amount of fill that the filler is allowed to add.
Hence the filler adds at most $\min(p_t, k) = a+b=a+0=a$ fill to
these cups.
The emptier thus is removing at least as much water as the filler
is adding to these cups, so the average fill has not increased,
and is still at most $2n-k$.

\noindent\textbf{Case 3}:
No cups in $A$ zero out on round $t$ and $b > 0$.\\
\textbf{Analysis}:
Consider $m_{S_{t+1}}(AC)$, which is the mass of the $k$ fullest
cups at state $S_{t+1}$. Each cup in $A$ was emptied from. The
filler adds at most $\min(k, p_t) = a+b$ fill to these cups.
Hence, 
$$m_{S_{t+1}}(AC) \le m_{S_t}(AC) + b.$$

The key insight necessary to bound $\mu_{S_{t+1}}(AC)$ is to
notice that larger values for $m_{S_t}(A)$ correspond to smaller
values for $m_{S_t}(C)$ because the invariants are satisfied at
state $S_t$.
In particular, because
$$m_{S_t}(C) \le \frac{c}{b+c} m_{S_t}(BC) = \frac{c}{b+c}(m_{S_t}(ABC) - m_{S_t}(A)),$$
we have 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:monotonicTECHOVER}
  m_{S_{t+1}}(AC) \le \frac{c}{b+c}m_{S_t}(ABC) + \frac{b}{b+c}m_{S_t}(A).
\end{equation}
As \eqref{eq:monotonicTECHOVER} is monotonically increasing in
both $m_{S_t}(A)$ and $m_{S_t}(ABC)$ we can upper bound
\eqref{eq:monotonicTECHOVER} by substituting the extremal values
of $\mu_{S_t}(A)$ and $m_{S_t}(ABC)$ in, namely $|A|(2n-|A|)$ and
$|ABC|(2n-|ABC|)$.
After some algebra (or via an elegant combinatorial argument) it can be shown that 
$$\frac{c}{b+c}|ABC|(2n-|ABC|) + \frac{b}{b+c}|A|(2n-|A|) \le k(2n-k)$$
which implies that the average fill of the $k$ fullest cups in
state $S_{t+1}$ is at most $2n-k$, as desired.

We have shown the invariant holds for arbitrary $k$, so given that the
invariants all hold at state $S_t$ they also must all hold at state $S_{t+1}$.
Thus, by induction we have the invariant for all rounds $t\in\mathbb{N}$.

\subsection{Oblivious Lower Bound}

In \cref{sec:oblivious} we provide filling strategies that an
oblivious filler can use to achieve backlog $n^{1-\varepsilon}$
for $\varepsilon \in (0, 1/2)$ constant against
\enquote{greedy-like} emptiers with probability at least
$1-2^{-\polylog(n)}$ in running time $2^{\polylog(n)}$; in this
subsection we sketch the proofs of these results. We remark that
this proof is by far our most technically difficult result;
however, the ideas driving the oblivious lower bound are similar
to those driving the adaptive lower bound. 

First we make some definitions.
The \defn{fill-range} of a set of cups at state $S$ is $\max_c
\fil_S(c) - \min_c \fil_S(c)$. A cup configuration is
\defn{$R$-flat} if the fill-range is at most $R$. An emptier is
called \defn{$\Delta$-greedy-like} if whenever there are two cups $c_1,
c_2$ with $\fil_{I_t}(c_1) > \fil_{I_t}(c_2) + \Delta$ the emptier 
doesn't empty from $c_2$ on round $t$ unless it also empties
from $c_1$ on round $t$. For an oblivious filler we only prove lower bounds
against $O(1)$-greedy-like emptiers; however this is a very 
interesting class of emptiers because all known randomized
algorithms for the cup game are $O(1)$-greedy-like \cite{mbe19, wku20}.
We define a new variant of the cup game: In the $p$-processor
\defn{$E$-extra-emptyings} \defn{$S$-skip-emptyings}
negative-fill cup game on $n$ cups, the filler distributes $p$
units of water amongst the cups, and then the emptier empties
from $p$ \textit{or more, or less} cups. In particular the
emptier is allowed to do $E$ extra emptyings and is also allowed
to skip $S$ emptyings over the course of the game.

Let $R_\Delta = 2(2+\Delta)$.
We now prove an important fact about $\Delta$-greedy-like emptiers.
\begin{lemma}[Sketch of proof of \cref{lem:flatalg}]
  \label{lem:TO_flatalg}
  There is an oblivious filling strategy \defn{$\flatalg$} that,
  given an $R$-flat configuration of cups, achieves an
  $R_\Delta$-flat configuration of cups against a
  $\Delta$-greedy-like emptier in the $p$-processor,
  $E$-extra-emptyings, $S$-skip-emptyings negative-fill cup game
  on $n=2p$ cups in running time $O(R+E+S)$. Throughout the
  duration of $\flatalg$ the cups are always $R$-flat.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The filler's strategy is to place $1/2$ units of fill into each
  cup on every round.
  Intuitively, if the fill-range of the cups is large then by
  greediness the emptier should be forced to empty from the
  fullest cups and not empty from the least full cups, thus
  decreasing the fill-range.
\end{proof}

Now we describe a well-known simple oblivious filling strategy
that will be used as a subroutine later.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:TO_randalg} % TO stands for technical overview 
  Consider an $R$-flat configuration of cups in the
  single-processor negative-fill cup game on $n$ cups with
  initial average fill $\mu_0$. Let $k \in [n]$. Let $d =
  \sum_{i=2}^k 1/i.$

  There is an oblivious filling strategy \defn{$\randalg(k)$}
  that achieves backlog $\mu_0 - R + d$ with
  probability at least $1/k!$ in time $O(k)$.

  Furthermore, when applied against a $\Delta$-greedy-like
  emptier with $R = R_\Delta$, even if the emptier is allowed
  arbitrarily many extra emptyings (i.e. if the game occurs in
  the $\infty$-extra-emptyings $\infty$-skip-emptyings cup game),
  $\randalg(k)$ guarantees that the cup configuration is $(R +
  d)$-flat on every round.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The filler maintains an \defn{active set}, initialized to being
  an arbitrary subset of $k$ of the cups. Every round the filler
  distributes $1$ unit of fill equally among all cups in the
  active set. Next the emptier removes $1$ unit of fill from some
  cup, or skips its emptying. Then the filler removes a random
  cup from the active set (chosen uniformly at random from the
  active set). This continues until a single cup $c$ remains in
  the active set. 
  If $c$ has never been emptied from, then its fill has increased
  by at least $1/k + 1/(k-1) + \cdots + 1/2 = d$
  from its starting value which was at least $\mu_0 -R$. Thus $c$
  has at least the desired fill if it has not been emptied from.
  By randomly removing cups from the active set the filler
  guarantees that, with probability at least $1/(k-1)!$, $c$ is not
  emptied from.

  Now we consider a greedy-like emptier that is allowed
  extra-emptyings. Let $\mathcal{A}_t$ be the event that the
  anti-backlog is smaller in $S_{t+1}$ than in $S_t$, let
  $\mathcal{B}_t$ be the event that some cup with fill equal to
  the backlog in $S_{t+1}$ was emptied from on round $t$. If
  $\mathcal{A}_t$ and $\mathcal{B}_t$ are both true on round $t$,
  then by greediness the cups are quite flat, in particular
  $R_\Delta$-flat. Consider a round $t_1$ where the cups are not
  $R_\Delta$-flat. Let $t_0$ be the last round that the cups were
  $R_\Delta$-flat. On all rounds $t \in (t_0, t_1)$ at least one
  of $\mathcal{A}_t$ or $\mathcal{B}_t$ must not hold. On a round
  where $\mathcal{A}_t$ does not hold, anti-backlog does not
  decrease and backlog increases by at most $1/(k-t+1)$, so fill
  range increases by at most $1/(k-t+1).$ On a round where
  $\mathcal{B}_t$ does not hold, anti-backlog decreases by at
  most $1$ and backlog decreases by at least $1-1/(k-t+1)$, as
  all cups with fill equal to the backlog in state $S_{t+1}$ were
  emptied from on round $t$, so fill-range increases by at most
  $1/(k-t+1)$. 
  Hence in total fill-range increases by at most $\sum_{i=2}^k
  1/i$ from $R$, i.e. the cups are $(R+d)$-flat on round $t_1$.

\end{proof}

We now give a method for transforming a filling strategy for
achieving large backlog into a filling strategy for achieving
high fill in many cups.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:TO_rep}
  {\normalfont
  Let $\alg_0$ be an oblivious filling strategy, that can get
  high fill (for some definition of high) in some cup against
  greedy-like emptiers with some probability. We construct a new
  filling strategy \defn{$\rep_\delta(\alg_0)$} as follows:

  Say we have some configuration of $n$ cups.
  Let $n_A = \ceil{\delta n}, n_B = \floor{(1-\delta)n}$. Let $N
  \gg n$ be large, let $M=2^{\polylog(N)}$ be a chosen parameter. 
  Initialize $A$ to $\varnothing$ and $B$ to
  being all of the cups. We call $A$ the \defn{anchor set} and
  $B$ the \defn{non-anchor set}. The filler always places $1$
  unit of fill in each anchor cup on each round. The filling
  strategy consists of $n_A$ \defn{donation-processes}, which are
  procedures that result in a cup being \defn{donated} from $B$
  to $A$ (i.e. removed from $B$ and added to $A$). At the start
  of each donation-processes the filler chooses a value $m_0$
  uniformly at random from $[M]$. We say that the filler
  \defn{applies} a filling strategy $\alg$ to $B$ if the
  filler uses $\alg$ on $B$ while placing $1$ unit of fill
  in each anchor cup. During the donation-process the filler
  applies $\alg_0$ to $B$ $m_0$ times, and flattens $B$ by
  applying $\flatalg$ to $B$ for $\Theta(N^2)$ rounds before each
  application of $\alg_0$. At the end of each donation process
  the filler takes the cup given by the final application of
  $\alg_0$ (i.e. the cup that $\alg_0$ guarantees with some
  probability against a certain class of emptiers to have a
  certain high fill), and donates this cup to $A$. 

We say that the emptier \defn{neglects} the anchor set on a round
if it does not empty from each anchor cup. We say that an
application of $\alg_0$ to $B$ is \defn{non-emptier-wasted} if
the emptier does not neglect the anchor set during any round of
the application of $\alg_0$.
}

\end{definition}

We use $\rep$ in two distinct places, first to get constant
backlog, and second to prove the Oblivious counterpart of the
Adaptive Amplification Lemma.
In the following proofs our goal is eventually to get backlog
$N^{1-\varepsilon}$ in $N$ cups. 

First we analyze $\rep(\randalg)$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:TO_obliviousManyUnknownCups}
  Let $\Delta \le O(1)$, let $h\le O(1)$, with $h \ge
  16(1+\Delta)$, let $k=\ceil{e^{2h+1}}$, let $\delta =
  \Theta(e^{-2h})$, let $n\ll N$ be sufficiently large. 
  Consider an $R_\Delta$-flat cup configuration in the
  variable-processor cup game on $n$ cups with initial average
  fill $\mu_0$.

  Against a $\Delta$-greedy-like emptier,
  $\rep_{\delta}(\randalg(k))$ using $M = \Theta(N^2)$
  either achieves mass $N^2$ in the cups, or with probability at
  least $1-2^{-\Omega(n)}$ makes an (unknown) set of $\Theta(n)$
  cups in $A$ have fill at least $h+\mu_0$ while also
  guaranteeing that $\mu(B) \ge -h/2 + \mu_0$, where $A,B$ are
  the sets defined in \cref{def:TO_rep}. The running time of
  $\rep_{\delta}(\randalg(k))$ is $\poly(N)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch of \cref{lem:TO_obliviousManyUnknownCups}] 
  We use the definitions given in \cref{def:TO_rep}.

Without loss of generality we assume that the emptier neglects
the anchor set at most $N^2$ times, and skips at most $N^2$
emptyings; otherwise the filler achieves mass $N^2$ in the cups.

We show that $\mu(B)$ never sinks too low. We do so by first
establishing that $B$ is always very flat, then showing that
$\mu(B)$ never rises too much higher than $\mu(AB)$, then
deducing that by greediness $\mu(A)$ never rises too high, and
finally by using the upper bound on $\mu(A)$ in the expression
$|A|\mu(A) + |B|\mu(B) = |AB|\mu(AB)$ to derive a lower bound on
$\mu(B)$.

Let $d = \sum_{i=2}^k 1/i = \Theta(h)$.
Because extra-emptyings and skip-emptyings of $B$ are limited,
using \cref{lem:TO_flatalg} $\flatalg$ and
\cref{prop:TO_randalg}, we can inductively show that $B$ is
always $(R_\Delta + d)$-flat, and that all applications of
$\flatalg$ make $B$ be $R_\Delta$-flat.

Now we claim that $$\mu(B) - \mu(AB) \le 2$$ always holds.
There are two ways that $\mu(B) -\mu(AB)$ can increase:\\
\textbf{Case 1:}
The emptier could empty from $0$ cups in $B$ while emptying
from every cup in $A$. \\
\textbf{Case 2:}
The filler could evict a cup with fill lower than $\mu(B)$ from
$B$ at the end of a donation-process. \\
In Case 1, by greediness, all cups in $A$ have fill no smaller
than $\Delta$ less than the backlog in $B$. Thus, $\mu(A) \ge
\mu(B) - \Delta$, which, since $|B|\gg |A|$, implies that 
$$\mu(B) \le \mu(AB) + 1.$$
Now consider a round where this is not the case, and consider how
much $\mu(B) - \mu(AB)$ could have grown since the last time that
Case 1 held. This difference increases the most if $B$ donates
cups with fill as far as possible below $\mu(B)$. Because the
running time of $\randalg(k)$ is $k-1$ the cup that $B$ donates
has fill at least $\mu(B) - R_\Delta - (k-1)$ where $\mu(B)$ is
the average fill of $B$ at the start of the application of
$\randalg$. Even if such a cup is donated on all of $n_A$
donation processes however, by design in choosing $n_B \gg n_A$
this would only increase $\mu(B)-\mu(AB)$ by $1$.
Hence 
$$\mu(B) \le \mu(AB) + 2.$$

By flatness of $B$ and greediness of the emptier no cup in $A$
ever has its fill rise higher than 
$$u_A = \mu(AB) + 2 + R_\Delta + d + 1.$$
Obviously $\mu(A)\le u_A$. Using this in the relation 
$$\mu(B) = -\frac{|A|}{|B|}\mu(A) + \frac{|AB|}{|B|}\mu(AB),$$
and again exploiting the choice $|B|\gg |A|$ we get
$$\mu(B) \ge -h/2 + \mu(AB) \ge -h/2 + \mu_0$$
as desired.

Now we show that we get a constant-fraction of the cups in $A$ to
have fill $\mu_0 + h$. If the emptier were not able to neglect
the anchor set, then by a Chernoff bound we would have that a
constant fraction of the applications of $\randalg(k)$ in a
donation-process succeed with exponentially good probability in
$M$. A successful application of $\randalg(k)$ yields a cup with
fill at least $\mu(B) - R_\Delta + d \ge h+\mu_0$ by our lower
bound on $\mu(B)$. In order to mitigate the problem that the emptier can
do extra-emptying we do many applications of $\randalg(k)$ and
choose randomly how many to do before donating a cup. Because the
emptier is limited to doing $N^2$ extra emptyings, taking
$M=\Theta(N^2)$ suffices to guarantee that with constant
probability each donation-process succeeds. Taking a second
Chernoff bound over the donation-processes gives that with
exponentially good probability in $n$ a constant fraction of the
donation-processes succeed. Taking a union bound over all of our
Chernoff bounds gives the desired probability of success. 

The running time of the filling strategy is clearly $$n_A O(M) (
O(N^2) + O(1)) = \poly(N),$$ as each of the $n_A$ donation
processes consists of $O(M)$ applications of $\randalg(k)$ and
$O(M)$ applications of $\flatalg$.

\end{proof}

Using \cref{lem:TO_obliviousManyUnknownCups} we show that an
oblivious filler can achieve constant fill in a known cup.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:TO_obliviousBase}
  Let $H \le O(1)$, let $\Delta \le O(1)$, let $n\ll N$ be at least a
  sufficiently large constant determined by $H$ and $\Delta$. 
  Consider an $R_\Delta$-flat cup configuration in the variable-processor cup
  game on $n$ cups with average fill $\mu_0$.
  There is an oblivious filling strategy that either
  achieves mass $N^2$ among the cups, or achieves fill at least $\mu_0 + H$
  in a chosen cup in running time $\poly(N)$ against a
  $\Delta$-greedy-like emptier with probability at least $1-2^{-\Omega(n)}.$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The filler starts by using $\rep_\delta(\randalg(k))$ with
  parameter settings as in \cref{lem:obliviousManyUnknownCups}
  where $h = H\cdot 16(1+\Delta)$, i.e. $k = \ceil{e^{2h+1}}$,
  $\delta = \Theta(e^{-2h})$. 
  If this results in mass $N^2$ among the cups we are done; we
  assume this is not the case for the rest of the proof.
  Let the number of cups which, with exponentially good
  probability in $n$, now exist by
  \cref{lem:obliviousManyUnknownCups} with
  fill at least $h+\mu_0$ be of size $nc = \Theta(n)$.

  The filler sets $p=1$, i.e. uses a single processor. Now the
  filler exploits the emptier's greedy-like nature to to get fill
  $H$ in a chosen cup $c_0$. Specifically, for $(5/8)h$ rounds
  the filler places $1$ unit of fill into $c_0$. Because the
  emptier is $\Delta$-greedy-like it must empty from the $nc$
  cups in $A$ with fill at least $h+\mu_0$ until $c_0$ has large
  fill. Over $(5/8)h$ rounds the cups in $A$ cannot have their
  fill decrease below $(3/8)h \ge h/8 + \Delta + \mu_0$. Hence,
  any cups with fills less than $h/8+\mu_0$ must not be emptied
  from during these rounds. The fill of $c_0$ started as at least
  $-h/2+\mu_0$ as $\mu(B) \ge -h/2+\mu_0$. After $(5/8)h$ rounds
  $c_0$ has fill at least $h/8+\mu_0$, because the emptier cannot
  have emptied $c_0$ until it attained fill $h/8+\mu_0$, and if
  $c_0$ is never emptied from then it achieves fill $h/8+\mu_0$.
  Thus the filling strategy achieves backlog $h/8 +\mu_0 \ge H +
  \mu_0$ in $c_0$, a known cup, as desired.

  The running time is of course still $\poly(N)$ by
  \cref{lem:TO_obliviousManyUnknownCups}.
\end{proof}

Next we prove the Oblivious Amplification Lemma.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:TO_obliviousAmplification} 
  Let $\delta \in (0, 1/2)$ be a constant parameter. Let $\Delta
  \le O(1)$. Consider a cup configuration
  in the variable-processor cup game on $n \le N, n >
  \Omega(1/\delta^2)$ cups with average fill $\mu_0$ that is
  $R_\Delta$-flat. Let $\alg(f)$ be an oblivious filling strategy
  that either achieves mass $N^2$ or, with failure probability at
  most $p\ge 2^{-\lg^8 N}$, achieves backlog $\mu_0 + f(n)$ on such cups
  in running time $T(n)$ against a $\Delta$-greedy-like emptier.
  Let $M = 2^{\polylog(N)}$.

  Consider a cup configuration in the variable-processor cup game
  on $n \le N, n > \Omega(1/\delta^2)$ cups with average fill
  $\mu_0$ that is $R_\Delta$-flat. There exists an oblivious
  filling strategy $\alg(f')$ that either achieves mass $N^2$ or
  with failure probability at most 
  $$p' \le np + 2^{-\lg^8 N}$$
  achieves backlog $f'(n)$ satisfying 
  $$f'(n) \ge (1-\delta)^2 f(\floor{(1-\delta)n}) + f(\ceil{\delta n}) + \mu_0$$ 
  and $f'(n) \ge f(n)$, in running time 
  $$T'(n) \le Mn\cdot T(\floor{(1-\delta)n}) + T(\ceil{\delta n})$$
  against a $\Delta$-greedy-like emptier.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We use the definitions and notation given in \cref{def:rep}. 

  Note that the emptier cannot neglect the anchor set more than
  $N^2$ times per donation-process, and the emptier cannot skip
  more than $N^2$ emptyings, without causing the mass of the cups
  to be at least $N^2$; we assume for the rest of the proof that
  the emptier chooses not to do this.

  The filler defaults to using $\alg(f)$ on all the cups if 
  $$f(n) \ge (1-\delta)^2 f(n_B) + f(n_A).$$
  In this case our strategy trivially has the desired guarantees. 
  In the rest of the proof we consider the case where we cannot
  simply fall back on $\alg(f)$ to achieve the desired backlog.

  The filler's strategy is roughly as follows:\\
  \textbf{Step 1:} Make $\mu(A) \ge (1-\delta)^2 f(n_B)$ by
  using $\rep_\delta(\alg(f))$ on all the cups,
  i.e. applying $\alg(f)$ repeatedly to $B$, flattening $B$ before
  each application, and then donating a cup from $B$ to $A$.\\
  \textbf{Step 2:} Flatten $A$ using $\flatalg$, and then use
  $\alg(f)$ on $A$.

  Now we analyze Step 1, and show that by appropriately choosing
  parameters it can be made to succeed.

  For this proof we need all donation-processes to succeed, as
  opposed to in the proof of \cref{lem:TO_obliviousManyUnknownCups}
  in which we only needed a constant fraction of the
  donation-processes to succeed. This necessitates choosing $M$
  very large. In particular we choose $M = 2^{\log^{24} N}$
  ---recall that $[M]$ is the set from which we randomly choose
  how many times to apply $\alg(f)$ in a donation-process. 
  By choosing $M$ this large we cannot hope to guarantee that
  every application of $\alg(f)$ succeeds: there are far too many
  applications. On the other hand, having $M$ so large allows us
  to have a very tight concentration bound on how many
  applications of $\alg(f)$ succeed. 
  By a Chernoff bound with probability at least $1-e^{-2Mp^2}$ at
  least $M(1-2p)$ of $M$ applications of $\alg(f)$ would succeed
  if the emptier did not interfere. The emptier can interfere
  with at most $N^2$ of the $M(1-2p)$ applications that would
  otherwise be successful. Let $1-q$ be the probability that a
  donation-process succeeds, i.e. the final application of $\alg(f)$ is not
  emptier-wasted and succeeds. We have
  $$1-q \ge (1-e^{-2Mp^2})\paren{\frac{M\cdot (1-2p)-N^2}{M}}.$$
  Rearranging, simplifying by loosening the bound, and using the
  assumption $p \ge 2^{-\lg^8 N}$, we can show
  $$q \le 2p + 2^{-\lg^8 N}.$$

  Taking a union bound we have that with failure probability at
  most $q \cdot n_A$ all donation-process successfully achieve a cup
  with fill at least $\mu_{t_0}(B) + f(n_B)$ where $\mu_{t_0}(B)$
  refers to the average fill of $B$ measured at the start of the
  application of $\alg(f)$; now we assume all donation-processes
  are successful, and demonstrates that this translates into the
  desired average fill in $A$.

  Let \defn{$\skips_t$} denote the number of times that the
  emptier has skipped the anchor set by round $t$. Consider how
  $\mu(B) - \skips/n_B$ changes over the course of the donation
  processes. As noted above, at the end of each donation-process
  $\mu(B)$ decreases due to $B$ donating a cup with fill at least
  $\mu(B) + f(n_B)$. In particular, if $S$ denotes the cup state
  immediately before a cup is donated on the $i$-th
  donation-process, $B_0$ denotes the set $B$ before
  the donation and $B_1$ denotes the set $B$ after the donation,
  then $\mu_{S}(B_1) = \mu_{S}(B_0) - f(n_B) / (n-i)$. Now we claim that
  $t\mapsto \mu_{S_t}(B) - \skips_t/n_B$ is monotonically decreasing. 
  Clearly donation decreases $\mu(B) - \skips/n_B$. 
  If the anchor set is neglected then $\mu(B)$ decreases, causing
  $\mu(B) - \skips/n_B$ to decrease. 
  If a skip occurs, then $\skips/n_B$ increases by more than
  $\mu(B)$ decreases, causing $\mu(B)-\skips/n_B$ to decrease. 
  Let $t_*$ be the cup state at the end of all the
  donation-processes. We have that 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:TO_harmonic1}
    \mu_{S_{t_*}}(B) - \frac{\skips_{t_*}}{n_B} \le \mu_0 - \sum_{i=1}^{n_A}\frac{f(n_B)}{n-i}.
  \end{equation}
  By conservation of mass we have 
  $$n_A\cdot \mu_{S_{t_*}}(A) + n_B\cdot \mu_{S_{t_*}}(B) = n\mu_0 + \skips_{t_*}.$$
  Rearranging, 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:TO_lowerboundingAharmonic}
    \mu_{S_{t_*}}(A) = \mu_0 + \frac{n_B}{n_A}\paren{\mu_0 +
    \frac{\skips_{t_*}}{n_B} - \mu_{S_{t_*}}(B)}.
  \end{equation}
  Now we obtain a simpler form of
  Inequality~\eqref{eq:TO_harmonic1}. Recalling that harmonic
  numbers grow like $\ln$ we have
  $$\sum_{i=1}^{n_A} \frac{1}{n-i} \approx \ln n/(n-n_A) \approx
  \ln \frac{1}{1-\delta} > \delta.$$
  Then using Inequality~\eqref{eq:TO_harmonic1} in
  Equation~\ref{eq:TO_lowerboundingAharmonic} we essentially have
  $$\mu_{S_{t_*}}(A) \ge \mu_0 + \frac{n_B}{n_A} \delta f(n_B)
  \approx \mu_0 + (1-\delta) f(n_B).$$
  Our bound here on the partial harmonic sum was not correct
  however; using a correct bound results in a slightly worse
  guarantee on $\mu(A)$, namely:
  $$\mu_{S_{t_*}}(A) \ge \mu_0 + (1-\delta)^2 f(n_B).$$

We have shown that in Step 1 the filler achieves average fill
$\mu_0 + (1-\delta)f(n_B)$ in $A$ with failure probability at
most $q \cdot n_A$.
Now the filler flattens $A$ and uses $\alg(f)$ on $A$.
It is clear that this is possible, and succeeds with probability
at least $p$.
This gets a cup with fill 
$$\mu_0 + (1-\delta)^2 f(n_B) + f(n_A)$$
in $A$, as desired.

Taking a union bound over the probabilities of Step 1 and Step 2
succeeding gives that the entire procedure fails with probability
at most 
$$p' \le p + q \cdot n_A \le np + 2^{-\lg^8 N}.$$

The running time of Step 1 is clearly $M\cdot n\cdot
T(\floor{(1-\delta)n})$ and the running time of Step 2 is clearly
$T(\ceil{\delta n})$; summing these yields the desired upper
bound on running time.

\end{proof}

Finally we prove that an oblivious filler can achieve backlog
$N^{1-\varepsilon}$. 
\begin{theorem}
  There is an oblivious filling strategy for the
  variable-processor cup game on $N$ cups that achieves backlog
  at least $\Omega(N^{1-\varepsilon})$ for any constant $\varepsilon
  >0$ in running time $2^{\polylog(n)}$ with probability at least
  $1-2^{-\polylog(n)}$ against a $\Delta$-greedy-like emptier
  with $\Delta \le O(1)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We aim to achieve backlog $(N/n_b)^{1-\varepsilon}-1$ for some
  $n_b \le \polylog(N)$ on $N$ cups.
  Let $\delta$ be a constant, chosen as a function of $\epsilon$.

  By \cref{prop:obliviousBase} there is an oblivious filling
  strategy that achieves backlog $\Omega(1)$ on $n$ cups with
  exponentially good probability in $n$; we call this algorithm
  $\alg{f_0}$. Let $n_b = \log^8(N)$. We can make $\alg{f_0}$
  achieve backlog $f_0(k) \ge H \ge \Omega(1)$ for all $k \ge
  n_b$, for constant $H \ge \Omega(1)$ to be determined ($H$ is a
  function of $\delta$). We construct $f_{i+1}$ as the
  amplification of $f_i$ using \cref{lem:obliviousAmplification}.

  One can inductively show that $f_{\Theta(\log N)}$ achieves
  backlog $(N/n_b)^{1-\varepsilon} -1$, as desired. Let
  $\varepsilon' = 2\varepsilon$. Of course $\Omega(N^\varepsilon)
  \ge \polylog(N)$, so $$(N/n_b)^{1-\varepsilon}-1 \ge
  \Omega(N^{1-\varepsilon'}).$$

  Let the running time of $f_i(N)$ be $T_i(N)$. From the
  Amplification Lemma we have following recurrence bounding $T_i(N)$:
  \begin{align*}
    T_i(n) &\le 2^{\polylog(N)} \cdot T_{i-1}(\floor{(1-\delta)n}) + T_{i-1}(\ceil{\delta n}) \\
            &\le 2^{\polylog(N)}T_{i-1}(\floor{(1-\delta)n}).
  \end{align*}
  It follows that $\alg{f_{i_*}}$, recalling that $i_* \le O(\log N)$, has running time
  $$T_{i_*}(n) \le (2^{\polylog(N)})^{O(\log N)} \le 2^{\polylog(N)}$$
  as desired.

  Now we analyze the probability that the construction fails. 
  Consider the recurrence $a_{i+1} = \alpha a_i + \beta, a_0 =
  \gamma$; the recurrence bounding failure probability is a
  special case of this. Expanding, we see that the recurrence
  solves to $a_k = \Theta(\alpha^{k-1})\beta + a^k \gamma$.
  In our case we have 
  $$\alpha \le N, \beta = 2^{-\lg^8 N}, \gamma = 2^{-\lg^8 N}.$$
  Hence the recurrence solves to 
  $$p_{i_*} \le 2^{-\polylog(N)},$$
  as desired.

\end{proof}
