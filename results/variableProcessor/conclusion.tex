% \section{Conclusion}

% We asked a natural question to extend understanding of the cup
% game: what if the resources of the players are variable?
% We found several shocking results, which combined demonstrate
% that having variable resources makes the cup game fundamentally
% changes the cup game.

% More work remains to be done on the variable-processor cup game.
% Extending our oblivious lower bound on backlog to apply to a
% broader class of emptiers, rather than just greedy-like emptiers,
% is an interesting open question. Analyzing versions of the cup
% game with variable resources and resources augmentation is also
% an interesting open problem.

% Our work suggests that looking at other scheduling problems in
% the context of variable resources is, surprisingly, a very
% interesting question.
