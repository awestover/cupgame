# adaptive lower bound
- um is $O(n!)$ pessimistic in prop? shouldn't it be more like
$n_0^{n/n_0} (n!)^{1/n_0}$, which is a bit better? note: bigger
base case leads to lower running time, and lower backlog (backlog $\ge n/(2 n_0)$). 

proof read oblivious section, while writing a technical overview
for it.
