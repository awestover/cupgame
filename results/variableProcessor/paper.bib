	Abstract = {We study the problem of scheduling periodic-time-critical tasks on multiprocessor computing systems. A periodic-time-critical task consists of an infinite number of requests, each of which has a prescribed deadline. The scheduling problem is to specify an order in which the requests of a set of tasks are to be executed and the processor to be used, with the goal of meeting all the deadlines with a minimum number of processors. Since the problem of determining the minimum number of processors is difficult, we consider two heuristic algorithms. These are easy to implement and yield a number of processors that is reasonably close to the minimum number. We also analyze the worst-case behavior of these heuristics.},

@article{FleischerKo04,
	Abstract = {In current networks, packet losses can occur if routers do notprovide sufficiently large buffers. This paper studies how many buffers should be provided in a router to eliminate packet losses.We assume a network router has m incoming queues, eachcorresponding to a single traffic stream, and must scheduleat any time on-line from which queue to take the next packet tosend out. To exclude packet losses with a small amount ofbuffers, the maximum queue length must be kept low over the entirescheduling period. We call this new on-line problem the balancedscheduling problem (BSP). By competitive analysis, we measure thepower of on-line scheduling algorithms to prevent packet losses. We show that a simple greedy algorithm is$\Theta$(log m)-competitive which is asymptotically optimal,while Round-Robin scheduling is not better thanm-competitive, as actually is any deterministic on-linealgorithm for BSP.We also give a polynomial time algorithm forsolving off-line BSP optimally.We also study another on-line balancing problem that tries tobalance the delay among the m traffic streams. },

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of scheduling a sequence of tasks in a multi-processor system with conflicts. Conflicting processors cannot process tasks at the same time. At certain times new tasks arrive in the system, where each task specifies the amount of work (processing time) added to each processor's workload. Each processor stores this workload in its input buffer. Our objective is to schedule task execution, obeying the conflict constraints, and minimizing the maximum buffer size of all processors. In the off-line case, we prove that, unless P = NP, the problem does not have a polynomial-time algorithm with a polynomial approximation ratio. In the on-line case, we provide the following results: (i) a competitive algorithm for general graphs, (ii) tight bounds on the competitive ratios for cliques and complete k-partite graphs, and (iii) a (Δ/2 + 1)-competitive algorithm for trees, where Δ is the diameter. We also provide some results for small graphs with up to 4 vertices.},
